title: Basic Aeropress Coffee
brewingMethod: Aeropress

This is one of my "base" recipes, for whenever I feel lazy. 
Simple, straightforward, but still hits the spot.

<div class="caution-box">
Be careful inverting the Aeropress, you can *really* mess it up.
Don't burn yourself.

Get a Prismo cap instead if you do it often.

Grind your 18 grams of coffee medium-coarse, at a 70 on the Kingrinder K6. 
Prepare the Aeropress; place one or two filters inside. Use the inverted style or a Prismo cap.

Get your water heated to 95Â°C before pouring it into the Aeropress, covering all the coffee, then start your timer.

Wait until 1 minute and 30 seconds have passed, then stir the coffee and make sure to disturb the crust on top until it's fully dissolved again.

At the 2:00 minute mark, place the Aeropress on a sturdy cup and begin pressing down slowly. Aim to take about 30 seconds for this, finishing at 2:30.
Press *through* the hiss.

Add milk and sugar to taste.
