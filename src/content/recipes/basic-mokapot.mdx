title: Basic Moka Pot Coffee
brewingMethod: Moka Pot

---

This has been my main breakfast coffee recipe for a while now.
It's simple and works nicely, with cleanup also being done quickly. 

The method is a somewhat adapted method of the standard Moka Pot recipe.
This one is scaled for a 2 cup Moka Pot.

## Ingredients
- 9 grams of finely ground coffee (50 clicks on a Kingrinder K6)
- Milk
- Syrup

## Brewing
Heat up your water to 100Â°C in a kettle. While you wait for this, turn on the heating plate to reduce heating time later.

Fill the base of your Moka Pot with the boiling water up to the safety valve, then wrap it with a towel so you can safely screw it closed again.
Place the Moka Pot on the hotplate.

While waiting for the coffee to brew, add the syrup/sugar you like into the cup. Saves you from having to stir it later, messing up the nice milk foam.

Observe the Moka Pot. This is going to take some practice, you want to take it off the moment *before* it starts loudly boiling over. 

You did it perfectly when you slide it off the hotplate and it then "peaks", before the temperature starts falling below that point immediately.
Pour the coffee into your cup, then add as much milk as you like.
